    ### plan ###
    # for composer in list_of_composers:
    # beautiful soup collections page
    # iterate over all collections, creating pieces/movements
    # if no pieces, skip (we want the base piece creation, not pdfs with all the
    # pieces in one)

    # ensure we have all pieces by iterating with imslp package. Skip if there are
    # conflicts on catalogue identifier
